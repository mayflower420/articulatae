					<h2>Only exceptional content can make people come to the theatres, says Sri Crazyminds</h2>
					<p class="article-summary">With the rise in popularity of OTT platforms , people are hesitant to shell out money to watch films in theatres and instead opt to wait for OTT releases.
He has to freshen up, drive to a theatre, and spend money on tickets and snacks before watching the movie.
The problem is content; it has to be really good.
Other films that do well in theatres are big-budget productions that have a stellar cast.
Around 400 movies are being sent to the censor board for approval but out of these hardly 200 actually get released in theatres.</p>

					<h2>2 land brokers arrested in Calangute murder case</h2>

Mapusa court has remanded Khalfe and Raje in 10-day police custody.Khalfe is a native of Ratnagiri, while Raje is from Pune.Fernandes, 64, a resident of Mapusa, was found dead under suspicious circumstances in her flat in Naikawaddo, Calangute, on Thursday.</p>

					<h2>42 killed in two separate bus accidents in Pakistan</h2>
					<p class="article-summary">Maryam Nawaz, Punjab’s chief minister, expressed her condolences over the accident.In the second accident, at least 25 people were killed when a passenger bus traveling from Haveli Kahuta in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to Rawalpindi fell into a ravine, police and officials said.
They asked authorities to ensure the injured get the best medical treatment.Millions of Shiite Muslims are currently taking part in the Arbaeen pilgrimage, the 40-day mourning rituals at the shrine of Imam Hussain, grandson of Prophet Muhammad, in Iraq’s holy city of Karbala.
Every year thousands of Pakistani Shias travel to Iraq to participate in the Arbaeen.
Many pilgrims opt to walk 80 km (50 miles) to Karbala from the nearby city of Najaf, where Imam Ali, Hussain’s father and Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law, is buried.Earlier this week at least 28 Pakistani Shiite pilgrims were killed when in a bus accident in Iran while they were er Norte to Iraq.
Their bodies were brought home on a Pakistani military plane on Saturday and buried in the southern province of Sindh.</p>

					<h2>Why TRAI's ‘September 1 deadline’ for Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea is ‘bad news’ for your OTPs</h2>
					<p class="article-summary">If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages.
This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages.
If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number.
At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates.
However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.</p>

					<h2>Wetland galvanises Chimbel to oppose Unity Mall project</h2>
					<p class="article-summary">Panaji:Chimbel residents, during a gram sabha held on Sunday, unanimously decided to resist the Goa Tourism Development Corporation ’s move to build a Unity Mall in the village.
The gram sabha members argued that the proposed location for the mall is “a wetland area adjacent to Chimbel lake”, which is considered ecologically fragile .
They said that the site must be conserved and that no construction should be allowed.Biodiversity Management Committee chairperson Govind Shirodkar said, “We are not opposed to the Unity Mall, we are opposing the proposed location.Let tourism minister Rohan Khaunte take this project to his constituency.
Why is he hell-bent on disrupting the lives of people belonging to the Scheduled Tribes?”He alleged that numerous trees have already been cut down for the project, and that this will result in significant harm to the environment.
“Earlier, govt wanted to set up an IT park at the same location; this time they want a mall there, but we will oppose it tooth and nail,” he said.Sarpanch Sandesh Shirodkar said that no application has been submitted to the panchayat by any authority seeking permission for the proposed Unity Mall project.</p>

					<h2>‘Take action against sound pollution by beach shacks’</h2>
					<p class="article-summary">Calangute:Villagers at Calangute gram sabha on Sunday demanded the loud music played by beach shacks be stopped as it is driving away quality tourists away from Calangute.“The sound of the music played in some shacks can be heard 2kms away because they’re using sound systems meant for concerts.
There is a competition between the shacks for playing the loudest music.Tourists, especially those with families, don’t want to sit in these shacks because of the loud music,” Manuel Cardozo, president of the Goan traditional shacks owners association , said.Sarpanch Joseph Sequeira said when the panchayat issues licences to shacks, they have to sign an affidavit stating that no music shall be played or fireworks will be displayed after 11pm.Sequeira said the reason for the loud music is that Calangute residents give their shacks on rent to outsiders.
“They play loud music because they have to recover the money to pay the rent,” the sarpanch said.It was pointed out that a noise monitoring committee was appointed following a high court order, but the committee has been inactive.
The gram sabha decided to revive the committee.Another resident, Clotildes Braganza, said that a Russian woman recently advertised her suspicious services on a banner that was put on the Calangute church gate.</p>

					<h2>Punjab: Pastors beat dad of 3 to death to expel ‘bad spirit’</h2>
					<p class="article-summary">GURDASPUR: A group of pastors beat an ailing father of three to death in what they called an exercise to expel a "malevolent" spirit from him in Punjab , reports Yudhvir Rana.Concerned over his repeated seizures, the family of Samuel, the victim, invited two pastors to their home to offer prayers on Aug 21, said Rakhal, Samuel's mother, a resident of Gurdaspur district.The duo then called in seven-eight more pastors to join in the prayers.
But, instead of providing spiritual assistance, they began kicking and slapping Samuel, and dragging him around till his body began to turn blue, Rakhal said.
"Whenever I, or his wife Sunita, tried to stop them, they insisted it was the ghost receiving the beating, not Samuel," she said.
He passed away a little later, Rakhal said.The police was informed the next day, and a case registered on the family's complaint.</p>

Going forward, govt may have to increase its share of the contribution in case market returns fall.
"UPS is good for retiring employees.
But they will miss the opportunity to potentially earn even higher returns," said D Swarup, former chairman of Pension Fund Regulator and Development Authority.
For most govt employees, a 50% assured return appears to be a safer bet.</p>

					<h2>Bhoma presses for bypass, says will block road-widening work</h2>
					<p class="article-summary">Ponda:The residents of Bhoma village are firm on their stand that they need a bypass road to avert the demolition of their houses for the widening of the highway.
At a gram sabha on Sunday, the villagers reiterated that they would never allow the road running through their village to be widened.The panchayat accepted the gram sabha resolution to write to the local MLA about the villagers’ demand.Sarpanch Damodar Naik assured the village of compliance in two days.The Centre has already issued a notification for acquiring land for road widening and letters on the valuation of land were sent to villagers whose houses and shops are slated to be demolished.Sanjay Naik, a Bhoma resident, said the valuation of their land was not proper, with Rs 6,000 per sqm applied as the rate.He said the villagers would take the legal route if govt failed to construct the bypass road.
“We have received support from several organisations which want to help us in our legal battle,” he said.According to govt plan, four houses and 11 kiosks are to be demolished for road widening at Bhoma.In a Feb gram sabha, the villagers had demanded a fresh project plan to save houses and kiosks.
They alleged that the road widening plan was drafted in haste and without consultations.
They had then also demanded that the panchayat write to Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari to scrap the plan.</p>
